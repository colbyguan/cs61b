# cs61b

A Vue.js front-end for teaching materials I write throughout Spring 2017 for Berkeley's CS 61B course. I'll soon write up how I put this website together in writeup.md!

Below is stuff from `vue-cli`:

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
